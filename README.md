# Predicting-if-the-customer-will-buy-the-new-magazing-or-not
A magazine re-seller is trying to decide what magazines to market to customers. In the “old days,” this might have involved trying to decide which customers to send advertisements to via regular mail. In the context of today and the “web,” this might involved deciding what recommendations to make to a customer viewing a web page about other items that the customer might be interested in and therefore want to buy. The two problems are essentially the same.    Here I have concluded which classification model gives the best accuracy and F1 Score and predicted if the customer will buy the magazine or not.
